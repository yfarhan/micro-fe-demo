# micro-fe-demo
Simple micro FE demo app
uses valtio for state management
----------------------------------------------------------------

Here we demonstrate the following :
1. base-app (parent)
  -- exports 3 components
  
2. app-one
  -- imports the above components and own components.
  -- sharing state between the two apps.

## Install :
will need to install apps ( *based-app* and *app-one* ) individually.
```
 $ cd base-app;
 $ npm install
 $ npm start
```
